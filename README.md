# charged-particules-simulator
The charged particles simulator allows placing a charged particle, infinite line, or infinite plane (the uniform charge for the bar and plane) and allows shooting a particle in the direction of these objects. It simulates the movement of the particle and shows how it slows down until it reaches the point of maximum approach.
